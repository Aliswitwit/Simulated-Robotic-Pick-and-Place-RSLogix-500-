# Simulated-Robotic-Pick-and-Place-RSLogix-500-
This ladder logic project simulates a simple robotic pick-and-place cycle using three sequenced actions: **arm extension**, **gripper closure**, and **arm retraction**. Each action is controlled by a dedicated timer, and the full sequence completes in approximately 7 seconds. Introduces core sequencing logic used in real industrial robot cells.
